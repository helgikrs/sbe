# How to build

It should be enough to call make. Allthough, building modules for linux
requires a configured and built tree (usually found in
/lib/modules/$KERNEL_VERSION).  If it is not there you'll have to either give a
parameter KPATH to make or change the parameter in the Makefile.

# How to load

Once the module has been built you can

sudo insmod ./ber_emulator.ko

which should create a new device /dev/sbea (ssd ber emulator, device name a)
that you can read and write to.
